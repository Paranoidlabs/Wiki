You can configure strongswan to create a `Virtual Tunnel Interface` (VTI) and
tunnel all traffic over that interface by using this updown script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

set -o nounset
set -o errexit

VTI_IF="plabs0"

case "${PLUTO_VERB}" in
        up-client)
                ip tunnel add "${VTI_IF}" local "${PLUTO_ME}" remote "${PLUTO_PEER}" mode vti \
                        okey "${PLUTO_MARK_OUT%%/*}" ikey "${PLUTO_MARK_IN%%/*}"
                ip link set "${VTI_IF}" up
                ip addr add "${PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP}" dev "${VTI_IF}"
                ip route add `ip route get "${PLUTO_PEER}" | head -1`
                ip route add "${PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT}" dev "${VTI_IF}"
                sysctl -w "net.ipv4.conf.${VTI_IF}.disable_policy=1"
                ;;
        down-client)
                ip tunnel delete "${VTI_IF}"
                ip route del "${PLUTO_PEER}"
                ;;
esac
```

You can use this script by saving it as e.g. `/usr/lib/strongswan/plabs_updown`
and changing this line in your `swanctl.conf`:

```
updown = /usr/lib/strongswan/_updown
```

to this line:

```
updown = /usr/lib/strongswan/plabs_updown
```

in your `children` section.


You can now limit the actual traffic selector installed by adding a line
`remote_ts = 10.84.0.0/16` (or any other subnet definition you like) into the
children section on the same level as the `updown` one.
