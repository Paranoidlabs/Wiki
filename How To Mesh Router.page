# How to Mesh Router

## Preparation

### Packages
The required packages are:

1. [Strongswan](https://stew.paranoidlabs.org/strongswan-5.5.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz)
2. [OpenNHRP](https://stew.paranoidlabs.org/opennhrp-0.14-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz)
  * You also need [desist](https://github.com/Dean4Devil/desist), however that is not available as a package at the moment
3. [Bird](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bird/)


Strongswan and OpenNHRP are also available from the plabs repository

### Certificates
Get yourself a [Machine Certificate]().


## Setting up strongswan

This article is not meant as an explanation as to why this works the way it does, see [DMVPN]() for that.

### Configuration

Download the attached `swanctl.conf` and `hub-common.conf` and drop them into your `/etc/swanctl/` directory.

### Certificates

1. Download the `RootCA`, `IntermediateCA` and `TechnologyCA` -Certificates from [pki.paranoidlabs.org](https://pki.paranoidlabs.org) and drop them into `/etc/swanctl/x509ca/`.
2. Download the `revoc.crt` and drop it into `/etc/swanctl/x509/`.
3. Rename your machine certificate to `mesh.der` and drop it into `/etc/swanctl/x509/`.
4. Drop your machine private key into either `/etc/swanctl/ecdsa/` or `/etc/swanctl/rsa/`, depending on it's type (if you are not sure which type you have, its most likely ECDSA).


## Setting up OpenNHRP

1. Download the attached opennrhp.conf and drop it into `/etc/opennhrp/`.

### Desist

1. Clone desist's repository
2. If you do not have clang installed, change the first line of the Makefile into `CC = gcc`
3. Compile using `make`
4. Move the created binary `desist` to `/etc/opennhrp/opennhrp-script`, replacing the existing script.

### Systemd
If you are using systemd, download the attached `opennrhp.service` and place it into `/etc/systemd/system/` (If you are using a more recent version of the OpenNHRP package it may come with a service file already - in that case *please* inform an admin to update this page.)

## Setting up Bird

1. Download the attached `bird.conf` and move it to `/etc/bird.conf`
2. **Change your Router ID!** Otherwise stuff **will** break and it will do so horribly.
3. Change interface names if necessary.

You can then set up additional dynamic routing, however this is out of the scope of this document.
