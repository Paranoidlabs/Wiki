# How to Mesh Router

## Preparation

### Packages
The required packages are:

#. [Strongswan](https://stew.paranoidlabs.org/strongswan-5.5.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz)
#. [OpenNHRP](https://stew.paranoidlabs.org/opennhrp-0.14-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz)
  * You also need [desist](https://github.com/Dean4Devil/desist), however that is not available as a package at the moment
#. [Bird](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bird/)


Strongswan and OpenNHRP are also available from the plabs repository

### Certificates
Get yourself a [Machine Certificate]().


## Setting up strongswan

This article is not meant as an explanation as to why this works the way it does, see [DMVPN]() for that.

### Configuration

Download the attached `swanctl.conf` and `hub-common.conf` and drop them into your `/etc/swanctl/` directory.

### Certificates

#. Download the `RootCA`, `IntermediateCA` and `TechnologyCA` -Certificates from [pki.paranoidlabs.org](https://pki.paranoidlabs.org) and drop them into `/etc/swanctl/x509ca/`.
#. Download the `revoc.crt` and drop it into `/etc/swanctl/x509/`.
#. Rename your machine certificate to `mesh.der` and drop it into `/etc/swanctl/x509/`.
#. Drop your machine private key into either `/etc/swanctl/ecdsa/` or `/etc/swanctl/rsa/`, depending on it's type (if you are not sure which type you have, its most likely ECDSA).


## Setting up OpenNHRP

#. Download the attached opennrhp.conf and drop it into `/etc/opennhrp/`.

### Desist

#. Clone desist's repository
#. If you do not have clang installed, change the first line of the Makefile into `CC = gcc`
#. Compile using `make`
#. Move the created binary `desist` to `/etc/opennhrp/opennhrp-script`, replacing the existing script.

### Systemd
If you are using systemd, download the attached `opennrhp.service` and place it into `/etc/systemd/system/` (If you are using a more recent version of the OpenNHRP package it may come with a service file already - in that case *please* inform an admin to update this page.)

## Setting up Bird

#. Download the attached `bird.conf` and move it to `/etc/bird.conf`
#. **Change your Router ID!** Otherwise stuff **will** break and it will do so horribly.
#. Change interface names if necessary.

You can then set up additional dynamic routing, however this is out of the scope of this document.
