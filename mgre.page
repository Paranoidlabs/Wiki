Multipoint GRE is a kind of GRE allowing for several p2p tunnels to be routed over one GRE interface.

On Linux such a tunnel can be added with:

`ip tunnel add mgre0 mode gre ttl 64 local 1.2.3.4`

A few things to note here:

- We do not specifiy a remote. This way the kernel will try to match all GRE packets to this interface
- We specify a local endpoint. This is not strictly necessary however you will get an error add tunnel "gre0" failed: File exists if you don't. See below for an explanation.
- A TTL of 64 or higher is necessary for Link-Local Multipoint to work.


### `add tunnel "gre0" failed: File exists`

The Linux GRE implementation is based on filters.
Filters include:

 - The recipient IP (local)
 - The senders' IP (remote)
 - Wether or not a Checksum is present
 - The key

The Interface gre0 appearing when you add a GRE tunnel has none of these filters set.
If you do not specify any of those filters either the Kernel has no way of deciding to which interface to send the packet.
Thus it errors if you try to add an interface without filters.
